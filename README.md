# SEARCH OF K NEAREST NEIGHBORS

### Abstract
The principle behind kNN is to find predefined number of training samples closest in distance to a new point and predict the label from these.
The number of samples is user input value (K) and can vary upto 16. If the value of K is 1, then the object is assigned to the single nearest neighbor.
